					<p class="title">Whenever There was Television, There was LG</p>
					<p class="desc">From black &amp; white to color, from color to digital, from digital to smart, LG had always been the forefront runner to lead these changes. Since the 1966’s first ever black &amp; white TV in South Korea, the computerized color TV in 1979, the first ever 60 inch PDP TV in 2001, the first FULL LED 3D TV with pushed boundaries and until the very first Curved OLED TV of 2013, LG’s pioneering technology and the pursuit of innovation made it all possible and will continue to step forward to create and share the next historical moments with you.  </p>
